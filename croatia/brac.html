        <p>We visited Brač on a national holiday, so much of the island was shuttered. Fortunately for us, the Olive Oil Museum in nearby Škrip was gracious to open for us and a few other groups. Our guide was welcoming and informative, with a quick wit that was both hysterical and entertaining. Seeing the original method used to make olive oil was fascinating, but learning more about olive oil itself was the most valuable part for me. Here in the United States, we know we have an issue with fake olive oil. Now, I feel like a much better-informed consumer. They have a tasting, and provide a gorgeous spread of olive oil, red wine vinegar, green and black olive tapenade, bread, fresh tomatoes, and wine.</p>

        <p>Brač provides much of the stone used for the construction of numerous monuments, churches, and buildings throughout Dalmatia. This stone can even be found in the White House here in the United States. Since we arrived on a holiday, we sadly did not see any vendors with Brač stone. However, I was able to find a few stone items in Trogir. I never truly outgrew my rock collecting phase, so I had to acquire a few trinkets to bring back home with me. I'd love to return and see more of this island in the future.</p>
