        <p>The Adriatic, while alluring, can be too chilly in May for some of us who prefer warmer waters. Mljet was the perfect opportunity to swim in the smaller lake area where the sea flows into the basin, allowing the sun to warm the waters nicely. Given the sea was the source of its water source, we expected the lake to be just as salty, if not more so; but we were pleasantly surprised at the ease with which we were able to float due to the salinity of the lake. The emerald saltwater cradled me so gently, I could have surrendered to its weightless embrace all day.</p>

        <p>An island within the larger lake harbors a still-standing 12th-century Benedictine monastery, an island within the island. I wish we had more time to explore this island, since the grounds are full of trails and smaller buildings. I imagined the people who were lucky enough to be there when it was first built, and how magical it would have been there on this breathtaking island, surrounded by such a beautiful landscape. Among all the islands we visited, Mljet, with its myriad outdoor activities, offered a serene escape from the usual bustle.</p>
