        <p>I’ve called California home for most of my life, yet the gates of Disneyland remained a mystery, until Thanksgiving week 2024, when I finally discovered them alongside my four‑year‑old niece, Tsuna. Together we turned that mystery into pure wonder on our maiden Disneyland voyage.</p>

            <p>We launched our adventure at the park entrance, where Belle greeted us with a warm smile. Spotting Tsuna’s bright “snow‑day” shirt, Belle stayed in character, extending a diegetic invitation for Tsuna to participate in the next snowball fight at Beast's castle.  Tsuna’s suspension of disbelief lit up her face, and she beamed at the suggestion.
            <br>Our first ride together was Peter Pan’s Flight, a nostalgic original ride of the park's opening lineup. While she was perched in a miniature galleon with Mom and Dad, the darkness proved overwheming for Tsuna, who let them know this ride is too scary. She preferred the gentle sway of Dumbo. Yet the nearby whale sculpture close to the Dumbo ride sent a shiver down her spine, and she declared she’d never board that ride again.</p>

            <p>On day three, Tsuna transformed into a miniature Belle. She arrived in a glittering princess dress, complete with matching shoes, Beauty‑and‑the‑Beast Mickey ears, a delicate tiara, and sparkling earrings. In the parking lot, Dad (AJ) slipped her into her shoes while Mom (Carrie) brushed a soft yellow eyeshadow onto her lids, echoing the hues of her ensemble.
            <br>Though rides weren’t her favorite, the moments that lingered longest were the Disney Junior Dance Party and the spontaneous diegetic embraces, when costumed characters paused to admire her dress, and the speaking characters (the ones with voices) addressed her as “Princess.” The music at the dance parties pulsed, the lights swirled, and Tsuna spun around with the characters and a group of other kids. She laughed, twirled, and the dance floor felt like a private stage just for her. The sheer joy on her face was unforgettable.</p>

            <p>During the Thanksgiving parade she waved frantically, calling out to every character she could spot: <q>Hey, Elsa! Over here!</q> and <q>Hey, Buzz! Over here!</q> The procession crescendoed with Santa’s booming laugh, a friendly wave, and a grin that sealed the magic in her memory. At the foot of Main Street, the iconic Disneyland Christmas tree towered over us, its ornaments as large as Tsuna’s head and presents dwarfing her tiny frame stacked at its base.
            <br>Snacks of Mickey‑shaped pretzels became an unexpected ritual: she meticulously peeled off the ears first, then methodically dismantled Mickey’s face, savoring each bite with the precision of a tiny connoisseur. Meeting every character she could find became a treasured scavenger hunt; Carrie dutifully collected Polaroids and signatures for a memory book, and Tsuna chased each encounter with the enthusiasm of a true Disney devotee. Daisy Duck, her absolute favorite, topped the list.</p>

        <p>One evening we successfully kept Tsuna awake long enough for her to experience the famed Disneyland fireworks show, fueled by a few sugary treats. Equipped with Granny and Papa's AirPods Max to soften the volume, she was ready. Her eyes were wide with wonder as the night sky ignited with spectacular booms over the castle, illuminating the crowd in bursts of color.</p>

        On the drive home, still buzzing from the excitement, Tsuna summed up the whole trip: <q>It feels like you’re flying through the air at Disneyland!</q> That first trip to the happiest place on Earth was nothing short of spectacular. Seeing it through Tsuna’s bright, unfiltered eyes turned my own long‑awaited visit into a treasured memory, a reminder that the greatest adventures are those shared with the people (and princesses) who make them unforgettable.
